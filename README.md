# Post Generator

## Introduction
Welcome to our ```Post Generator``` ! 

This project is built using Vite and React, aiming to provide a seamless user experience with a responsive UI across various devices. Below, you'll find details on the folder structure, reusable components, custom hooks, error handling, and ensuring responsiveness.

## Folder Structure
Our project follows a clear and organized folder structure to enhance maintainability and scalability:
```
/src
  /assets
  /components
    /Button
    /Input
    /Loader
    /Posts
  /layout

```

## Reusable Components
We emphasize creating reusable components to streamline development and ensure consistency throughout the application. Each component is designed to serve a specific purpose and can be easily integrated into different parts of the application.

## Custom Hooks
To encapsulate business logic and promote code reuse, we've developed custom hooks tailored to our application's needs. These hooks abstract away complex logic into reusable functions, enhancing code readability and maintainability.

## Proper Error Handling
Error handling is a crucial aspect of our application to provide users with informative feedback and ensure smooth operation. We employ various error handling techniques, including try-catch blocks, validation checks, and error messages displayed to users in a clear and concise manner.

## Responsive UI
Creating a responsive UI is essential to deliver a consistent user experience across devices of different screen sizes. Our application is designed and tested to adapt seamlessly to various viewport dimensions, utilizing media queries and responsive design principles.
